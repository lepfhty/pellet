The deprecated Pellet DIG interface, any of the tests and CLI commands that relate to it have been removed.

The test files that are required as resources for the pellet-test module are unavailable, so the relevant tests will fail until they are made available.


If the pellet-query module fails to install due to an Out of Memory Exception, run maven using:
    
    MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m" mvn clean install
